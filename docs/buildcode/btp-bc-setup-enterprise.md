### Run Booster


SAP Business Technology Platform provides interactive guided boosters to automate cockpit steps, so users can save time when trying out the services.

Select booster **Get Started with SAP Build Code** to automatically assign entitlements, update your subaccount (or create a new one), create a service instance, subscribe to and access the Build Code UI.

1. On the navigation sidebar, click **Boosters**.

    Search for **Build Code** and click the tile to access the booster.

2. Check the "Components" the booster will install and click **Start**.

3. Booster Step 1: 

    The booster checks if the necessary entitlements for Build Code are available and free in the Global Account and you have the authorization to create Subaccounts and Services. 

    The result must be "All required prerequisites are met":

    In case you miss the prerequisites, the booster will inform you. 

    If SAP Build Code entitlement is missing, the booster prerequisites check will fail.
    
    If optional entitlements are missing, the booster will give you a warning.

    


4. Booster Step 2: 

    If you want to create a dedicated subaccount for the service instance, choose **Create Subaccount**. 
    
    If you want to use an already created subaccount, choose **Select Subaccount** (the selection comes in the next step). 
   
    For this tutorial, you create a dedicated subaccount. Click **Next**.

5. Booster Step 3:

    The booster lists the services and their plans, which it will create.

    - SAP Build Code
    - SAP Business Application Studio
    - SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition
    - Cloud Foundry (optional if you do not want to deploy applications in Cloud Foundry)

    Provide the details for your subaccount:

    - name: e.g. "sub_for_build_code"
    - Provider: Of your choice
    - Region: typically close to your location.
    - Space: e.g., "dev".

    Keep the autogenerated values for Subdomain and Org, or provide your own value.
