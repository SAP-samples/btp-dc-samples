# Setup SAP Build Code with Free Service Plans for Enterprise Accounts

<!-- description --> Use the SAP BTP booster "Get Started with SAP Build Code (Free Plan)" to create a service instance of Build Code and Business Application Studio.

Make sure you have the entitlement for the Service [SAP Build Code](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-build-code?region=all&service_plan=standard&commercialModel=cloud)


Setting up a Trial Account is pretty similar, but is covered in the previous tutorial.


## Prerequisites
- You have an Enterprise Account on SAP BTP.  
- You are entitled to use the Build Code service with free Service Plan.




## You will learn
  - Access your SAP BTP account
  - Create a new subaccount for SAP Build Code (optional)
  - Run the guided "booster" **Set up account for Build Code (Free Plan)** to assign entitlements, update your subaccount (or create a new one), create a service instance, subscribe to and access the Build Code "Lobby"

---

### Go to your SAP BTP account


1. Open your [SAP BTP cockpit](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit).

2. Access your global account.

### Run Booster


SAP Business Technology Platform provides interactive guided boosters to automate cockpit steps, so users can save time when trying out the services.

Select booster **Set up account for Build Code (Free Plan)** to automatically assign entitlements, update your subaccount (or create a new one), create a service instance, subscribe to and access the Build Code UI.

1. On the navigation side bar, click **Boosters**.

    Search for **Build Code** and click the tile to access the booster.

3. Booster Step 1: 

    The booster checks if the necessary entitlements for Build Code are available and free in the Global Account and you have the authorization to create Subaccounts and Services. 

    The result must be "All required prerequisites are met":

    In case you miss the prerequisites, the booster will inform you. For example about missing entitlements.

    


4. Booster Step 2: 

    If you want to create a dedicated subaccount for the service instance, choose **Create Subaccount**. If you want to use an already created subaccount, choose **Select Subaccount** (the selection comes in the next step). 
   
    For this tutorial, you create a dedicated subaccount. Click **Next**.
