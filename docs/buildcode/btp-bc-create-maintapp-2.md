# Create a Maintenance Notifications App with SAP Build Code

Part 2: Extend the application.

### Add an External Resource to your Project

You can now connect your S/4HANA Cloud backend to your application.

1. Click on the "+" to add a new external resource.

2. Select "Service" and "SAP System" as Provider.

    Select the BTP destination you created for this mission and select "Add to Project".

3. The destination "API_MAINTNOTIFICATION_CC7" will be added as an External Resource. Thus, you can now use backend data instead of sample data.

### Add Logic to your Application Service

The next step is to add the logic to create a new maintenance notification every time a notification is created on the SAP BTP. For this, we will create a new CAP handler, which is invoked before a new notification is created in CAP.



1. On the Storyboard under "Services", select MaintenanceNotification -> Then right-click and select "Add Logic".

    In the section "Standard Event", select "Create".

4. Click "Open Code Editor". This will open a dialog box. Select Application Logic.

    The maintenancenotification-logic.js tab will open.

    Go to Joule to ask for creating a new maintenance notification with backend data and create a new record number. Enter this prompt:

    ```/cap-app-logic #srv/code/maintenancenotifications-logic.js For each new notification create also a new Maintenance Notification, connecting to and then calling the external service. The Maintenance Notification should have a notification type of ‘M1’ and its notification text should be the problem description of the notification. Update the notification’s record number from the MaintenanceNotification field of the new Maintenance Notification.```

5. Joule Code Assistant will create a proposal. Review the generated code. To apply the code, click "Accept". The code will be applied to maintenancenotification-logic.js

You created the application logic.
