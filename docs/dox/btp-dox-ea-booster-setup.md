# Set Up Document Information Extraction in Enterprise Accounts

<!-- description --> Use the SAP BTP booster "Set up account for Document Information Extraction" to create a service instance of Document Information Extraction and a subscription to the UI application for Document Information Extraction.

Depending on your entitlements you can choose three available [Service Plans](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/document-information-extraction?region=all&tab=service_plan)

- Base Edition: Supports only default-extractors, managed by SAP. 
- Free: Same as Base Edition, with technical limits for uploaded documents and size. Not for productive use.
- Premium Edition: Includes document information extraction using generative AI. 

Setting up a Trial Account is pretty similar, but is covered in a dedicated tutorial.


## Prerequisites
- You have an Enterprise Account on SAP BTP.  
- You are entitled to use the Document Information Extraction service.


## You will learn
  - Access your SAP BTP account
  - Create a new subaccount (optional)
  - Run the guided "booster" **Set up account for Document Information Extraction** to assign entitlements, update your subaccount (or create a new one), create a service instance, subscribe to and access the Document Information Extraction UI
