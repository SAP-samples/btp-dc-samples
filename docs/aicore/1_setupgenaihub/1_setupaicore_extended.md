# Setup Generative AI Hub in an Enterprise Account

SAP AI Core is a service in the SAP Business Technology Platform that is designed to handle the execution and operations of your AI assets.

SAP AI Launchpad is a multitenant software as a service (SaaS) application in SAP Business Technology Platform. You can use SAP AI Launchpad to manage AI use cases (scenarios) across multiple instances of AI runtimes (such as SAP AI Core). 

SAP AI Launchpad also provides generative AI capabilities via the Generative AI Hub.


### Check your Entitlements for AI Core and AI Launchpad

You can setup AI core and AI Core with different service plans. 

 - Free-tier with limited capabilities and only community support.
 - Standard for "classic" AI.
 - Extended for using the Generative AI Hub

In order to check your global entitlements of your Enterprise Account, open SPA BTP Cockpit and access your Global Account. 

Select "Entitlements" --> "Service Assignments" and search for "AI".

In this case you see, that you are entitled for the SAP AI Core Service Plan "extended", which allows you to use Generative AI Hub. You can go on with this tutorial.

In addition you need a **Cloud Foundry Runtime** entitlement.

### Change the AI Core Service Plan to "Extended"


1. In You Subaccount go to "Entitlements" and search for "AI". 

    You see that the booster could not select the Service plan "extended". So you have "Standard".

    In order to change this, select "Configure Entitlements" and then "Add Service Plans".
