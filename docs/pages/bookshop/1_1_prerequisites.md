# Get started with SAP Cloud Application Programming, Fiori and HANA cloud 

The **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)** is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers along a ‘golden path’ of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on domain, by capturing domain knowledge and intent instead of imperative coding.

**Core Data Services (CDS)** is SAP´s universal modeling language to capture static, as well as behavioral aspects of problem domains in conceptual, concise, and comprehensible ways, and hence serves as the very backbone of CAP.

## Prerequisites

Have a SAP BTP Subaccount (Cloud Foundry Subaccount, not Neo!) with Business Application Studio (BAS).

If you want to deploy your app in BTP Cloud Foundry:

- Enable **Cloud Foundry** (CF) in your Subaccount and have free Cloud Foundry Runtime quota.
- Have a **SAP HANA Cloud** Subscription or free entitlement for setup.

Optional: A **SAP Build Work Zone** Subscription.

> Note: If you are not yet familiar with the setup and basics of Business Technology Platfrom (BTP), Subaccounts, Business Application Studio and SAP Build Work Zone complete this very detailed guide on SAP Discovery Center first:

### Additional Resources  

#### Reference Documentation

* This tutorial is based on the bookshop example of [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) aka "capire". 
  But it is not the same. The namespace is different and the coding is partially different.
* Github Repository containing the [bookshop example](https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples). The procedure is different.
