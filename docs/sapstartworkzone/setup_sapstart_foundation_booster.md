# Set Up SAP Start with Booster and include Joule

SAP Start is a predefined central entry point that enables accessing SAP cloud business solutions that are integrated with it and displays user-specific business content from these solutions.

SAP Start is based on SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition with the service plan "foundation" or "standard".

The initial setup of SAP Start can be done either by an automated setup that is based on running a SAP BTP Global Account Booster, or by a manual setup.

For manual setup and more information, see the SAP Start documentation at [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/start/sap-start/setup).

### Set Up with Boosters

For automated set up you can either use the Booster "Set Up SAP Start" or the Booster "Set up an account for SAP Task Center with SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition"

The Booster "Set Up SAP Start" will use the SAP Build Work Zone service plan "foundation", which is restricted. It contains only one site in Build Work Zone, the  SAP Start site. 

**Note:** You cannot upgrade later from the foundation service plan to a "standard" service plan. You have to add SAP Task Center Service manually. You cannot use an existing Subaccount. In this case use manual setup. You can still use the booster for training.

The Booster "Set up an account for SAP Task Center with SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition", uses service plan "standard", which allow you to create addition Work Zone Sites. It also installs and integrates SAP Task Center with SAP Start.

In base cases you have to include your Joule system afterwards manually to use Joule in SAP Start.

### Prerequisites for Booster "Set Up SAP Start"

- You need an entitlement for SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition service plan foundation.

- You need a Cloud Identity Services tenant (Identity and Authentication service, IAS). If you don't have one, create one first. If you need help creating one, see the Discovery Center mission [Get Started with SAP BTPâ€”Cloud Identity Service Provider](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4325/4605/).

- Optional: You need an entitlement for Joule with a service plan foundation (or standard for some license models)
