# Options to Set Up SAP Build for Joule Studio

You can set up SAP Build in two different ways.

You can set-up SAP Build services using a specific set-up Booster for SAP Build Process Automation, Joule, and optional SAP Build Work Zone.

Or you can use the "Cloud Integration Automation" service, a free service in SAP BTP, which offers a guided approach for setting up scenarios.

### Option 1: Set-Up SAP Build with Cloud Integration Automation service

Cloud Integration Automation service provides you a guided workflow to integrate SAP cloud solutions to on-premise and other SAP cloud solutions. The guided workflow contains instructions for manual and automated tasks to enable an easy and quick integration configuration setup.

For supported scenarios see [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration-automation/user-guide/overview?locale=en-US).

Cloud Integration Automation service is only available in the following [Data Centers](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration-automation/user-guide/prerequisites).

This mission contains tutorial which helps you to set up Cloud Integration Automation service and get started.


### Option 2: Set-Up Standalone SAP Build Services with Boosters from SAP BTP Cockpit

Boosters are a set of guided interactive steps that enable you to select, configure, and consume services on SAP BTP to achieve a specific technical goal.

You can access them directly from your desired global account in the SAP BTP cockpit, by choosing Boosters in the navigation menu. This leads to a page where you can find an overview of all available boosters, grouped by capability. From this overview page, you can get quick information about a booster, start a booster, or choose a tile to access the booster details.

For more information see [SAP Help Portal, Boosters](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/boosters?locale=en-US).
