# Optional: Integrate your standalone SAP Build Environment in SAP Build Work Zone

After you have created your first Joule Studio app, you can later optionally integrate your standalone SAP Build environment with your Joule project as a "Dynamic URL" app into your SAP Build Work Zone (e.g., for testing). When you create a new app in the Content Manager, choose:

- System: SWZ_Joule
- APP UI Technology: Dynamic URL
- Relative Path to APP (example): /webclient/standalone/da_myjouleskillsenv

  (example for a "standalone environment" and the name "myjouleskillsenv")

Provide a "Semantic Object" and an "Action" of choice.
