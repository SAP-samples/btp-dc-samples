# Options to Set Up SAP Build for Joule Studio

You can set up SAP Build in two different ways.

You can set up SAP Build services using a specific Setup Booster for SAP Build Process Automation, Joule, and an optional SAP Build Work Zone.

Alternatively, you can utilize the "Cloud Integration Automation" service, a free service in SAP BTP, which provides a guided approach for setting up scenarios.

### Option 1: Set-Up SAP Build with Cloud Integration Automation service

Cloud Integration Automation service provides you with a guided workflow to integrate SAP cloud solutions with on-premise and other SAP cloud solutions. The guided workflow provides instructions for both manual and automated tasks, enabling a quick and easy integration configuration setup.

For supported scenarios, see [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration-automation/user-guide/overview?locale=en-US).

The Cloud Integration Automation service is only available in the following [Data Centers](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration-automation/user-guide/prerequisites).

This mission includes a tutorial that guides you through setting up the Cloud Integration Automation service and getting started.


### Option 2: Set-Up Standalone SAP Build Services with Boosters from SAP BTP Cockpit

Boosters are a set of guided interactive steps that enable you to select, configure, and consume services on SAP BTP to achieve a specific technical goal.

You can access them directly from your desired global account in the SAP BTP Cockpit by choosing Boosters in the navigation menu. This leads to a page where you can find an overview of all available boosters, grouped by capability. From this overview page, you can get quick information about a booster, start a booster, or choose a tile to access the booster details.

For more information, see [SAP Help Portal, Boosters](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/boosters?locale=en-US).

This mission includes a tutorial that guides you through setting up SAP Build for Joule Studio with standalone services.

### Option 3: Subscribe to Standalone SAP Build Services manually

This mission includes a tutorial that helps you manually subscribe to SAP Build Process Automation, SAP Build Work Zone, and Joule to set up your Joule Studio.
