# Get started with SAP Cloud Application Programming, Fiori and SAP HANA cloud 

The **SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)** is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers with proven best practices and out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks. CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on domain, by capturing domain knowledge and intent instead of imperative coding.

**Core Data Services (CDS)** is SAPÂ´s universal modeling language to capture static, as well as behavioral aspects of problem domains in conceptual, concise, and comprehensible ways, and hence serves as the very backbone of CAP.
