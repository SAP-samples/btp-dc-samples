## Description
The goal of this mission is to create a basic CAP application using data model, service and a Fiori application in SAP Business Application Studio.
You will extend the CAP application and the Fiori to get a basic bookshop application. 
Optionally you can deploy the application to on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Cloud Foundry, using SAP HANA Cloud and HTML5 Repository from SAP Build Work Zone service. Once deployed on HANA cloud, you can use the backend database for hybrid testing.

* Check the  **Prerequisites** 
* Setup **SAP HANA Cloud** as production database
* Setup your **SAP Launchpad Service** - to give you access to create and configure the central point of entry for your users.
* Setup your **SAP Business Application Studio** - to give you access to the development environment. 
* Create a ***CAP app** - from the scratch within minutes.
* Add a Fiori App to your CAP Project.
* Deploy your CAP app to your BTP **Subaccount** and run it.
